How do we implement an assignment?

E.g. x = 3

what variations are possible?

x, y = 3

x + y = 3

Let's consider the simplest case, and go on to the more complex ones later. 

In the simplest case, there's an already declared identifier, followed by the `=` signs, followed by some value.

The value can be a number, a string, or another already declared identifier. 

As a first step, we should figure out the syntax for it. How about:

"assignment": {
    "assignee": identifier 
    "value": {
        "data_type": num/string,
        "value": 123
    }
}

alternatively, or.. 

how do we parse it? 

I see an identifier.. and i think, cool so there's an identifier here. But what is it doing here? It has to be part of some assignment, or declaration, otherwise it has no business being here. 

If the line starts with an identifier, that's the only way to interpret it. 

So if I find a symbol that's not in keywords, the next token better be an `=` or an operand, otherwise it should throw a parsing error. Expected a declarion or an assigment. 

Wait, no.. the symbol after the identifier *has* to be `=`. 

okay, so whatever, we do this:
